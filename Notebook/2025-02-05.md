### Minkowski sum

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition>

- Also comes in Geometry; Physics: space time and relativity;

- The Minkowski sum of two sets of position vectors $A$ and $B$ in Euclidean space is formed by adding each vector in $A$ to each vector in $B$,
  $$
  A + B = \{ \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \mid \mathbf{a} \in A, \mathbf{b} \in B \}
  $$

#### ~ Minkowski difference

### 1D case

- ~ Minkowski sum behaves like a union of $O$ and $-A$

### 2D case

- Dilation, Erosion

### Convex sets

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set>

- A set $S$ is convex iff every line segment connecting the two points in $S$ is contained in $S$.

### Convex hull

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull>
- May be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the set of points.

## Types of robots

- Holonomic constraints
- Non-holonomic constraints
  - Kino-dynamic constraints

**Note:**
$$
\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \neq \mathbb{S}^2
\qquad \text{but rather} \quad
\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \cong \mathbb{T}^2
$$
