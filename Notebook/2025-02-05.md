### Minkowski sum

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition>

- Also comes in Geometry; Physics: space time and relativity;

- The Minkowski sum of two sets of position vectors $A$ and $B$ in Euclidean space is formed by adding each vector in $A$ to each vector in $B$,
  $$
  A + B = \{ \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \mid \mathbf{a} \in A, \mathbf{b} \in B \}
  $$

#### ~ Minkowski difference

### 1D case

- ~ Minkowski sum behaves like a union of $O$ and $-A$

### 2D case

- Image processing operations: Dilation, Erosion

![Dilation, Erosion](./TeX/2025-02-05/1.png){ width=90% }

### Convex sets

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set>

- A set $S$ is convex iff every line segment connecting the two points in $S$ is contained in $S$.

### Convex hull

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull>
- May be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around the set of points.

## Types of robots

- Holonomic constraints
  - Result from physical restrictions
  - Make it impossible for the robot to enter enter some regions of the configuration space
  - Don't significantly complicate the path planning problem
  - Exclude restricted regions from $\mathcal{C}_{\text{free}}$
  - Eg: Elbow joint of robotic arm restricted to $90^\circ$ range of motion
- Non-holonomic constraints
  - Don't directly restrict accessible regions, instead restrict movement from one configuration to another
  - Eg: Inability of a car to slide sideways into a parking spot
  - Complicate the path planning problem and require specialised algorithms
  - Can also arise from system dynamics $\implies$ Kino-dynamic constraints

- Can represent non-convex objects as the union of convex parts

$$
\text{Configuration space} = \text{Free space } \cup \text{ Obstacle space}
$$

- **Note:** Cartesian products

$$
\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \neq \mathbb{S}^2
\qquad \text{but rather} \quad
\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \cong \mathbb{T}^2
$$

## Star algorithm

- Defining the contour of a configuration space
- Based on sorting the normals to the edges of the polygons on the basis of angles
- Every edge from $O$ and $A$ is used exactly once in the construction of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$
- Inward edge normals for $A$ and outward edge normals for $O$

### Types of contacts

#### EV contact

- Edge of $A$ is in contact with a vertex of $O$
- The motion vector should be perpendicular to the vector normal to the surface of the robot

#### VE contact

- Vertex of $A$ is in contact with an edge of $O$
- While the robot is sliding around the obstacle, the motion vector of the robot should be perpendicular to the vector normal to the surface of the obstacle

### Contour calculation (without rotation)

- The normal vector doesn't depend on the configuration of $A$ since rotations are not considered
- $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$ can be completely characterised by intersecting the resulting half planes for each of the Type EV and VE contacts
- Yields a convex polygon with $n+m$ sides, where $n \to$ number of edges of the robot, $m \to$ number of obstacles
- ~ Tracing out some origin of $A$

### Polyhedral obstacles

- Types of contacts
  - Type FV: A face of $A$ and a vertex of $O$
  - Type VF: A vertex of $A$ and a face of $O$
  - Type EE: An edge of $A$ and an edge of $O$

## Sampling-based strategies/ approaches

- Avoids explicit construction of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$
- Enables development of planning algorithms that are independent of the particular geometric model, since the motion planning algorithm considers the collision detection module as a black box
