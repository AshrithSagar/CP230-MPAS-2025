- Closed world assumption
  - Information agent only knows as much as the information it's exposed to

## Informed search strategies

### Best first search

- A greedy search
- Node quality is estimated by the shortest distance to the goal node
- Straight line distances

## $\mathcal{A}^*$ search algorithm

- Avoid already expensive paths
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(B^D)$
  - Exponential, which is problematic
- ~ Fails with negative path weights
- Admissible heuristics
- Variations
  - $\mathcal{MA}^*$ search algorithm
    - Limit memory
  - $\mathcal{SMA}^*$ search algorithm
- Genetic algorithm
  - Has no guarenteed optimalty though
- "Able-bodied person" $\to$ Normal
