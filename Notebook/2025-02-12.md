### `generate RRT`

Build a tree through generating next stages in the tree by executing random commands

```plaintext
generate_RRT(x_init, K, dt):
Tree.init(x_init)
for k = 1 to K do
  x_rand = random_state()
  x_near = nearest_neighbour(x_rand, Tree)
  u = select_input(x_rand, x_near)
  x_new = new_state(x_near, u, dt)
  Tree.add_vertex(x_new)
  Tree.add_edge(x_near, x_new, u)
return Tree
```

  - `random_state`
    - Often uniformly chosen at random over space with probability $99\%$, and goal state with probability $1\%$
    - This ensures to attempt to find the goal semi-regularly

  - `nearest_neighbour`
    - Need to find (approximate) nearest neighbour efficiently
    - Can use a *k*-d tree data structure
  - `select_input`
    - A two value boundary problem
    - Often, just select best out of a set of control sequences, randomly or well chosen set of primitives, if too hard to solve


### Pseudocode

```plaintext
Q_goal: Region that identifies success
Graph(V, E): Graph, initialised as empty
while i < limit:
	x_new = random_position()
	if is_in_obstace(x_new): then continue
	x_nearest = nearest_neighbour(G, x_new)
	link = chain(x_new, x_nearest)
	Graph.append(link)
	if x_new in Q_goal: return Graph
return Graph
```

| Tree Structure | Construction Complexity | Query Complexity | Memory Complexity |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| KD Tree        | $O(n \log n)$           | $O(\log n)$      | $O(n)$            |
| Ball Tree      | $O(n \log n)$           | $O(\log n)$      | $O(n)$            |

### *k*-d trees

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kdtreeogg.ogv>
- A $k$-dimensional binary tree, in which every node is a $k$-dimensional point, ~dividing space into half spaces

- Balanced *k*-d trees

- Nearest neighbour search
  - Quickly eliminate large portions of the search space, by using the properties of *k*-d tree

### RRT versions

#### Growing RRT

#### Bidirectional RRT

- ~ Starting searching from both start and goal nodes

#### Resolution complete RRT (RC-RRT)

- Observed that nearest points chosen for expansion are often the ones stuck behind an obstacle
- For each node in the tree, keep track of its constraint violation frequency ($\text{CVF}$)
- $\text{CVF}$ is initialised to 0 when adding a node to the tree
- When an expansion of a node is unsuccessful, increase $\text{CVF}$ of that node by 1, increase $\text{CVF}$ of the parent node by $1/m$,  increase $\text{CVF}$ of the grand parent node by $1/m^2$, and so on, ~propogating backwards
- When a node is selected for expansion, skip over it with probability $\text{CVF}/m$, where $m$ is the maximum number of times willing to expand each node

## RRT* algorithm

- Records the distance each vertex has travelled relative to its parent vertex, termed as `cost`
- After the closest node is found, checks its neighbourhood in a fixed radius for a lower cost node, and replaces with it
- Rewiring the tree $\to$ Reconnects neighbors to a new vertex if it lowers their cost, after connecting to the cheapest neighbor
- Rewiring makes the path smoother, eliminating the cubic structure of RRT algorithm
- Asymptotically optimal
