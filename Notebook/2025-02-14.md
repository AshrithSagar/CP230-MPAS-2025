## Case studies

- Global and local planners
- Map creation; SLAM
- Gaussian splatting
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting>
  - Direct rendering of volume data without converting into surface or line primitives
- Collison cones
  - Based on relative velocities (?)
  - To predict and prevent potential collisions between moving objects
  - ~ Represents the set of directions or velocities that, if chosen by the robot, would lead to a collision with an obstacle
  - Particularly useful when both robot and obstacle are in motion
- Challenges
  - Collision aware decision making; Can use collision cones;
  - Demand aware task scheduling; Can use Multi-armed bandits;
- Humans vs Robots
  - Reasoning, dexterity, robustness, etc
- LMD-FISH
  - LLM based task distribution

## Search strategies

- BFS, DFS, weights aren't considered
  - BFS and monarchy analogy
- Dijkstra's algorithm
  - <https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Dijkstra.html>
- Utility $\to$ Long term reward
  - Introduce a discount factor, for convergence reasons

$$
U(i) = R(i) + \sum_{j} M_{ij}^{P(i)} U_t(j)
$$

  - Model $M_{ij}^a = P(j \mid i, a) \to$ Probability that on action $a$, we go from state $i$ to $j$.
- ~In passive RL, a fixed policy is used
