## Target prediction algorithms

- Different target prediction algorithms for automotive, HRI and VR digital twins

## Rapid aiming movements

### Woodworth's study

- With visual feedback, error in movement $\propto$ speed of the movement, else no dependency observed

### Fitt's law

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law>

- The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.

- Involves a logarithmic law

$$
\text{ID} = \log_{2} \Bigg( \frac{2D}{W} \Bigg)
$$

- Useful in machine-human interface

## Imitation learning

### Learning from demonstrations (LfD)

#### Inverse reinforcement learning

- Time consuming, but accurate
- Given expert demonstrations, learn the reward function

#### Behaviourial cloning

- Similar to a signal processing approach

## Digital twins

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin>
- Trajectory planning algorithms
- Walking trajectory prediction
- Kalman filters
- Particle filters
  - Doesn't requre training data
  - Increasing number of particles improves performance at the cost of complexity
- Artificial neural networks
