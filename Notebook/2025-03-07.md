## Introduction to Game theory

### Prisoner's dilemma

- Nash equilibrium strategy (NE)
  - Best strategy if others also play using it
  - To check for NE, fix one of the player's strategy and think from the other player's perspective
- NE doesn't exist for games like rock, paper, scissors; NE not applicable

### Hamstrung squad game

- Game rules
  - Police can move 2 steps
  - Prisoner can move 1 step on all directions in the grid; ~8 directions;
  - Police get the first move
- Cost incurred to capture the prisoner
- Payoff; Minimum number of steps to capture the fugitive

- Assignment: Solve up to $n = 10$ steps

### Differential games

- Can't directly calculate the payoff from the strategies
- Tenet of transition
  - Similar to Bellman optimal policy finding procedure

### Homicidal chauffeur challenge

- Evader and Persuer
- Game of kind
  - Solution is obtained by solving tenet of transition
  - Payoff is terminal: Either 0 or 1
- Game of degree
  - Can't be solved theoretically like game of kind
  - Need numerical analysis
