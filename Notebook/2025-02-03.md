## Spaces

- <https://modernrobotics.northwestern.edu/nu-gm-book-resource/2-5-task-space-and-workspace/>
- Abstract spaces of a robot

### Configuration space ($\mathcal{C}$-space)

- The $\mathcal{C}$-space is the space of all possible configurations of a robot

- Each configuration of the robot is mapped to a point in the configuration space
- Number of dimenstions of the configuration space is the number of degree of freedoms available for the robot
- Divided/ Partitioned into free space and obstacle space

#### Free space (~$F$-space) ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{free}}$)

- $F \subseteq C$
- Configurations that are not occupied by any obstacles
- Portion that is collision-free
- Free configuration: Configurations in the free space

#### Obstacle space ($\mathcal{C}$-obstacle) ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$)

- Locus of the infeasible configurations due to the obstacles
- Obstacle representations in configuration space
- ~Determined by the obstacles as well as the robot

### Task space

- Determined only by the task at hand, not the robot

### Work space

- Set of positions (and/or orientations) that can be reached by the end-effector
- Determined by the robot, nothing to do with the task

#### Dextrous workspace

- Set of positions that can be reached by the end-effector with all possible orientations

## Motion planning approaches

- Motion planning involves defining, discretising and searching the $\mathcal{C}$-space, respectively

### Exact algorithms

- Exactly compute paths in the continous space
- Involves solving through equations, or showing that no path exists

- Very computationally expensive

### Search-based planning

- Discretise the $\mathcal{C}$-space into a graph
- Solve the SP problem via a LC-algorithm
  - Can use the search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's etc) once the problem is formulated in this manner
- Computationally expensive in higher dimensions
- Yields resolution completeness and some optimality

### Sampling-based planning

- Sample the $\mathcal{C}$-space and construct an incremental path

- Weak completeness provided

## Grid-based seach

- Divide into grids (discretisation), and run the search algorithms
- Problems with this cell decomposition
  - When mixed cells are present
    - Some cells can be present in both free and obstacle space
    - There might be a possbility that the only path that exists, might be through obstacles
      - ~Is such a situation avoidable, if possible?
  - Progressive cell decomposition is a computational overhead over time
    - The decomposition is done incrementally, refining the grid resolution over time
    - Starting from a coarse grid and moving to a finer grid
    - Finer grids might increase computational complexity making it infeasible for the search algorithms
  - Potential fields & ~separability?
    - Want to achieve some separability, ~which can be done through skeletonisation?

### Optimality

- Depends on the way one defines it
- Shortest paths, in the sense of what (perceived) weights one assigns to the edges
- The weights assigned are not the true weights but rather the perceived weights, technically
- Eg: Fuel cost

### Skeletonisation

- Converting a motion planning problem to a graph search problem
- Voronoi diagrams

- Suboptimal, but ensures separation from obstacles

## The piano movers problem

- <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.1588>
- The piano movers problem (a classical example)
- Cobot
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobot>
  - ~Collaborative robot, designed to work alongside humans

### Formulation

- Define $\mathcal{W} \to$ ~work space?

## ~Algorithmic decidability

- NP-hard problem, NP-complete problem
- Relaxing optimalilty conditions helps in solving an NP-hard problem

- Comparing algorithms in terms of efficiency, completeness and complexity
