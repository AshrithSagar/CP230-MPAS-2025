## Configuration space

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_space_(physics)>

- Moving in joint space, moving in cartesian space
  - Moving in joint space doesn't need inverse kinematics
  - Points in the higher dimensional joint space can be mapped to a configuration of the robot

- Forward, Inverse kinematics

- Algebraic Topology

- Generalised coordinates

- Books
  - Russel & Norvig, Chapter 25.4, Configuration space
  - Stephen LaValle, Chapter 2

- Semi-Dirac fermion
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Dirac_fermion>
  - Mass in only one direction

- For a single linkage robotic arm in 3D space, we have

  - $$
    \mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{R}^3 \times \operatorname{SO}(3)
    $$

  - 6 dimensional configuration space

  - Considering position and orientation as well

- For an $n$ linkage robotic arm

  - $$
    \mathbb{Q} = {\left[ \mathbb{R}^3 \times \operatorname{SO}(3) \right]}^{n}
    $$
