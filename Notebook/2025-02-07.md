## Star algorithm

- Defining the contour of a configuration space
- Based on sorting the normals to the edges of the polygons on the basis of angles
- Every edge from $O$ and $A$ is used exactly once in the construction of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$
- Inward edge normals for $A$ and outward edge normals for $O$

### Types of contacts

#### EV contact

- Edge of $A$ is in contact with a vertex of $O$
- The motion vector should be perpendicular to the vector normal to the surface of the robot

#### VE contact

- Vertex of $A$ is in contact with an edge of $O$
- While the robot is sliding around the obstacle, the motion vector of the robot should be perpendicular to the vector normal to the surface of the obstacle

### Contour calculation (without rotation)

- The normal vector doesn't depend on the configuration of $A$ since rotations are not considered
- $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$ can be completely characterised by intersecting the resulting half planes for each of the Type EV and VE contacts
- Yields a convex polygon with $n+m$ sides, where $n \to$ number of edges of the robot, $m \to$ number of obstacles
- ~ Tracing out some origin of $A$

### Polyhedral obstacles

- Types of contacts
  - Type FV: A face of $A$ and a vertex of $O$
  - Type VF: A vertex of $A$ and a face of $O$
  - Type EE: An edge of $A$ and an edge of $O$

## Sampling-based strategies/ approaches

- Avoids explicit construction of $\mathcal{C}_{\text{obstacle}}$
- Enables development of planning algorithms that are independent of the particular geometric model, since the motion planning algorithm considers the collision detection module as a black box
