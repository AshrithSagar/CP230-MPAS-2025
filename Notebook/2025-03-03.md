## Motion Planning with Aerospace Applications

- The main objective of guidance is to direct one object to move in such a way as to enable it to come as close as possible to another object
- LOS: Line of separation
- Capturability
  - $V_R$ and $V_\theta$
- Engagement trajectory in $(V_R, V_\theta)$-space
- Stationary points: $V_R = 0, \ V_\theta = 0$
- Collision condition: $V_R < 0$
- Collision triangle
- Inverse collision triangle
- Miss distance/ Distance of closest approach: $V_R = 0, \ V_\theta \neq 0$

### Capturability condition

- The target is captured if the following holds

$$
R_{\text{miss}} \leq R_{\text{lethal}} \implies \vert V_{\theta 0} \vert \leq \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{lethal}}^2}{R_0^2 - R_{\text{lethal}}^2}} \ \vert V_{R 0} \vert
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{\text{miss}} & = R_0 \sqrt{\frac{V_{\theta 0}^2}{V_{\theta 0}^2 + V_{R 0}^2}} \\
t_{\text{miss}} & = \frac{- R_0 V_{R 0}}{V_{\theta 0}^2 + V_{R 0}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Zero and non-zero miss distance
- For non-collision, we need $R_{\text{miss}} > R_{\text{lethal}}$

### Avoidance

- Violation of the capture conditions leads to a *no capture* situation
