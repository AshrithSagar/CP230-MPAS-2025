## Robot path planning

- Want a sequence of control inputs that lead from the state node $X_s$ to the goal node $X_g$

- Global path planning
  - Global map is accessible
  - Algorithms: $A^*$, Dijkstra's, RRT
- Local path planning
- Miscellaneous
  - Coverage path planning
    - Goal is to cover all areas
    - Eg: Cleaning robots
- Visibility graphs
- Minkowski sum

## Sampling-based motion planning

- Boundary value problems
  - Solved by non-linear optimisation

### Probabilistic roadmap approach (PRM)

- Sample points from the configuration space, ~~specifically the free space~~
- Milestones: Points in the free space
- Connect nearest neighbour nodes through collision-free paths
  - Points cannot lie on obstacles
  - Paths cannot pass through obstacles

- Computationally more practical than $A^*$
- Can implement in $O(n \log (d / \varepsilon))$?
- Probabilisticly complete, while sampling more points

#### Sampling

- Uniform sampling in $[0, 1]^n$
  - Can obtain unbiased samples
- Uniform sampling on $n$-D unit sphere
  - No bias for any particular direction
- Uniform sampling for 3D orientations
  - Generating random unit quaternions from a normal distribution

#### Limitations

- Need to solve boundary value problems

- Needs collision checking; Cannot avoid
