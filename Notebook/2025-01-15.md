## Shortest path algorithms

- Finding the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph

### Dijkstra's algorithm

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>
- Constraint: Only positive edge cycle graphs allowed
- Uses a priority queue to greedily assign
- Time complexity
  - $O(|V|^2)$
  - Although needs prior knowledge that graph only has positive cycles

### Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm

- BFSPA

  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm>
  - <https://algorithms.discrete.ma.tum.de/graph-algorithms/spp-bellman-ford/index_en.html>

- Negative cycle

  - A cycle which sums to a negative value
  - BFSPA can detect negative cycles
  - If any negative cycle is present, then there is no shortest path

- Relaxation

  - BFSPA relaxes all edges, and repeats $|V|-1$ times

- Algorithm

  - ```plaintext
    Bellman-Ford(Graph, source):
        Initialize distance for each vertex:
            for each vertex v in Graph:
                distance[v] = infinity
            distance[source] = 0
        
        for i = 1 to |V| - 1:  # |V| is the number of vertices
            for each edge (u, v) in Graph.edges:
                if distance[u] + weight(u, v) < distance[v]:
                    distance[v] = distance[u] + weight(u, v)
    
        # Check for negative-weight cycles
        for each edge (u, v) in Graph.edges:
            if distance[u] + weight(u, v) < distance[v]:
                print("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")
                return None
        
        return distance
    ```

- Time complexity

  - $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$
  - Slower than DA
  - Can be applied to a larger class of graphs

- BFSPA speed up algorithms exists

- Selecting ordering of the edges
