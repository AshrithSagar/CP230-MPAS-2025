## Shortest path algorithms

- Finding the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph

### Dijkstra's algorithm

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm>
- Constraint: Only positive edge cycle graphs allowed
- Uses a priority queue to greedily assign
- Time complexity
  - $O(|V|^2)$
  - Although needs prior knowledge that graph only has positive cycles

### Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm

- BFSPA

  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm>
  - <https://algorithms.discrete.ma.tum.de/graph-algorithms/spp-bellman-ford/index_en.html>

- Negative cycle

  - A cycle which sums to a negative value
  - BFSPA can detect negative cycles
  - If any negative cycle is present, then there is no shortest path

- Relaxation

  - BFSPA relaxes all edges, and repeats $|V|-1$ times

- Algorithm

  - ```plaintext
    bfspa():
      for V-1:
        for E:
          relax()
    
    relax():
    ```

- Time complexity

  - $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$
  - Slower than DA
  - Can be applied to a larger class of graphs

- BFSPA speed up algorithms exists

- Selecting ordering of the edges
