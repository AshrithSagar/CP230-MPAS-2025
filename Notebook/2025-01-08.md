- Graph theory
  - Tree: an acyclic directed graph
  - Adjacency matrix
- Grid structure

## State space search

- IUI: Intelligent user interface
- **State space**
  - Has all legitimate state transitions
- Travelling salesman problem
- **State space model**
  - **Goal predicate**: Test to see if the goal is reached or not
  - Minimise cost of operations

### Search strategies

- Uninformed search strategies
- Informed search strategies

## Uninformed search strategies

- Useful for small state spaces

### Breadth first search

- FIFO queue
- Heuristic for order of sequence
- Stopping conditions
- ~ Order of states at same hierarchy don't matter
- $B \to$ Maximum branching factor
- $D \to$ Depth of tree
- $1 + B + B^2 + B^3 + \dots B^D \implies \mathcal{O}(B^D)$
  - Number of nodes generated
- Is complete
- Is optimal, w.r.t. number of nodes
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(B^D)$
- Space complexity: $\mathcal{O}(B^D)$
- Big-Oh notation $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$, is sort of like an upper bound

### Depth first search

- LIFO queue
- Linear in depth, a main advantage
- ~ Better space complexity

### Iterative deepening search

- Has a limit
- Space complexity stays linear

### Bidirectional search

- Search from both start and goal node and wait till meet in the middle

## Criterion for comparing algorithms

- **Completeness**
  - If there is a solution, the algorithm eventually gets it, given enough time and space.
- **Optimalty**
  - Optimalty is defined w.r.t. a criterion
- **Time complexity**
- **Space complexity**
