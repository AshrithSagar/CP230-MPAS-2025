\section*{Question 3}

\textbf{Transformed primitive}

Let \( \mathcal{A} \) be a unit disc, centered at origin, and \( \mathcal{W} = \mathbb{R}^2 \).
Assume that \( \mathcal{A} \) is represented by a single, algebraic primitive, \( H = \{ (x, y) \mid x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \} \).
Show that the transformed primitive is unchanged after any rotation is applied.
