*Half planes and Algebraic sets*
![Tasks](./Files/algebraic-sets.png)

Write the inequalities to get these sets.

## Rotation Matrices

Using rotation matrices, prove that 2D rotation is commutative but 3D rotation is not.

## Transformed primitive

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a unit disc, centered at origin, and $\mathcal{W} = \mathbb{R}^2$.
Assume that $\mathcal{A}$ is represented by a single, algebraic primitive, $H = \{ (x, y) \mid x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \}$.
Show that the transformed primitive is unchanged after any rotation is applied.
