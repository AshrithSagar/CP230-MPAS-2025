# Assignment-6

1. Consider three robots `A`, `B`, and `C`, moving on a plane in straight lines inside a square shaped enclosure.
    Select the speed of the robots from the set $[10, 50] \text{ m/s}$ and their radius in the set $[1, 5] \text{ m}$.
    Assume size of the enclosure to be $200 \text{ m} \times 200 \text{ m}$.
    Sketch the velocity obstacles for each robot.
    Assume random position and direction of motion of the robots.

    You may use graph sheets to sketch the answer, or use plain paper but ensure that the measurements are to scale.
    Scan and send your answers.

2. Consider only robots `A` and `B` from the above example.
   Determine the velocity obstacle for robot `A` and identify that part or region of the velocity obstacle, so that if robot `A`â€™s velocity vector lies in this region, it will take more than $5$ seconds for collision.
   This could be an approximate answer.
