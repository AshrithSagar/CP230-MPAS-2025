\section*{Hamstrung squad game}

Solve the Hamstrung squad game for a payoff of up to 10.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
      \item The police's initial location could be anywhere.
      \item For the initial fugitive location relative to the police, compute the payoff (steps taken to catch the fugitive; pursuer minimises it, and evader maximises it).
      \item The police makes the first move.
\end{enumerate}
Show the grid, initial Police location and the payoff values up to 10. \\
P.S. To better understand it, first try playing it against a friend, like a game of chess, without thinking about the optimality aspect!
