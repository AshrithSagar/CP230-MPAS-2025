# Assignment-2

1. Consider two robots of radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, moving in straight lines such that initially the distance between them is shrinking.

    (a). Find the distance between them at the point of closest approach when they do not collide, and the time at which this happens.

    (b). Find out the times at which they first collide and then the time at which they get out of collision, assume the robots to be permeable.

    In both cases, choose the initial conditions accordingly.
    Choose the values of all parameters such as radii, initial positions, directions, speeds, etc.

2. Solve the above problem when these are ships which can be modeled as two ellipses moving in the direction of their major axes.
Again, choose the parameter values.

    (In both problems you may use MATLAB if you are not able to derive the equations needed to answer the questions.)
