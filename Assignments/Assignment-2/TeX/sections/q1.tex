\section*{Question 1}

Consider two robots of radii \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), moving in straight lines such that initially the distance between them is shrinking.
\begin{enumerate}[label= (\alph*), noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item Find the distance between them at the point of closest approach when they do not collide, and the time at which this happens.
    \item Find out the times at which they first collide and then the time at which they get out of collision, assume the robots to be permeable.
\end{enumerate}
In both cases, choose the initial conditions accordingly. Choose the values of all parameters such as radii, initial positions, directions, speeds, etc.

\subsection*{Solution}
