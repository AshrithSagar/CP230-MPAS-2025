\section*{Question 2}

Solve the above problem when these are ships which can be modeled as two ellipses moving in
the direction of their major axes.
Again, choose the parameter values.

\subsection*{Solution}

The problem becomes anisorotropic in this setup.
Let the shapes of the robots be ellipses with major axes \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) and minor axes \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) respectively.
The equation of the ellipse for the first robot is
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{(x - x_1)^2}{a_1^2} + \frac{(y - y_1)^2}{b_1^2} = 1
\end{equation*}
and for the second robot is
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{(x - x_2)^2}{a_2^2} + \frac{(y - y_2)^2}{b_2^2} = 1
\end{equation*}

We can consider the effective radius of the ellipses, and introduce eccentricity \( e \),
\begin{align*}
    e_1 = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b_1^2}{a_1^2}}, \qquad
    e_2 = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b_2^2}{a_2^2}}
\end{align*}
The effective radius of the ellipses are
\begin{align*}
    R_1 = a_1(1 - e_1), \qquad
    R_2 = a_2(1 - e_2)
\end{align*}

The analysis can be done in a similar way as before, but with the new eccentricity factor \( e \) added in the equations.
