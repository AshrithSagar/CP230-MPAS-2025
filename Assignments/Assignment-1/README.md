# Assignment-1

Deadline: 26th Feb 25

Please find the attached grid structure: `grid.zip`

The ZIP file contains a Python script, `grid.py` and `grid.txt` file.
`grid.py` defines the grid along with the start, goal, and obstacle coordinates.
Running this script will generate a `grid.txt` file where:

- "S" represents the start,
- "G" represents the goal,
- "X" represents obstacles.

Find a path from source to destination using Q-learning.
Show the following parameters to TAs during evaluation

1. The initial values of reward and Q
2. The path returned by the algorithm
3. There will be 1600 grids - show TAs for how many grids you calculated the Q values
4. The final values of Qs
5. The function or line in the program where the Q-values are being updated.
