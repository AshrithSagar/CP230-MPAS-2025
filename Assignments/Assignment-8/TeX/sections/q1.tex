\section*{FIFO Priority Exploration}

Consider a graph with 20--30 nodes.
Provide the array of active nodes in FIFO order and the set of explored nodes at each iteration.
For first 3--4 iterations, explain how the array is being populated and which nodes are being removed.

Give the steps for searching from initial state \(I\) to  goal state \(G\) using FIFO priority function.
