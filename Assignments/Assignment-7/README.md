# Assignment-7

Consider a robot `A` initially moving in a straight line towards a robot `B` which is moving in a circle.
Consider three time instances $t_0 < t_1 < t_2$.

At $t_0$, determine the velocity obstacle and select a velocity for robot `A` from the avoidance set.
Do the same at times $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Plot the trajectories of robots `A` and `B`.
You may solve the problem graphically (but make sure it is to scale).

Assume velocities, positions, time instances, etc., to be of reasonable values.
