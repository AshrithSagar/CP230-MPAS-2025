# Assignment-10

1. Consider a 40 $\times$ 40 grid map.

2. Assume 6 obstacles, each covering about 100 cells.

3. Assume 2 robots (assume that they start from the same cell. Sensor range is 6 cells).

4. Find the route of each robot using coordination algorithm for 10 steps. $P(d)$.

In each iteration,

1. Shade and distinguish the frontier cells, the explored and the unexplored cells.

2. Mention the utilities of the cells and how the utilities are being updated.

3. Trace the robot path.
