\section*{Coordination algorithm}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, leftmargin=0.5cm]
    \item Consider a \( 40 \times 40 \) grid map.

    \item Assume 6 obstacles, each covering about 100 cells.

    \item Assume 2 robots (assume that they start from the same cell. Sensor range is 6 cells).

    \item Find the route of each robot using coordination algorithm for 10 steps. \( P(d) \).
\end{enumerate}
In each iteration,
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Shade and distinguish the frontier cells, the explored and the unexplored cells.

    \item Mention the utilities of the cells and how the utilities are being updated.

    \item Trace the robot path.
\end{enumerate}
