# Assignment-3

1. Consider a geometry,

    Assume values for $\gamma = \frac{V_A}{V_B}, R_0, \cancel{\theta_0}, \alpha_{B0}$.

    **(a).** Find the collision cone. Find $\alpha_A$

    **(b).** Take different values of $\gamma$. Are there values of $\gamma$ for which

    - CC does not exist?
    - There are more than one CC. How many are possible?
